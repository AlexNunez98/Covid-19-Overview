        <p><h3>High Risk For Covid-19</h3></p>
        <p>
          Kids that are at the highest risk of getting Covid-19 are those that have prior help issue such as
          <ul>
            <li>Diabetes</li>
            <li>Lung Disease</li>
            <li>Congenital Heart Conditions</li>
            <li>Conditions that Weaken the Immune System</li>
            <li>Obesity</li>
          </ul>
          In some cases, severe illness strikes infants that are less than a year old.
          <br>
          Kids show less symptoms than adults and elderly, so overall less kids are hospitalized.

        <p><h3>High Risk Places</h3></p>
        <p>
          Places that have high risk rates of coming in contact with an individual that has Covid-19 and possibly getting Covid-19 yourself are those where large numbers of people get together and get confined into a small area. Some examples are
          <ul>
            <li>Bars</li>
            <li>Churches</li>
            <li>Concert Halls</li>
            <li>Threathers</li>
            <li>Beaches</li>
            <li>Hair and Nail Salons</li>
            <li>Gatherings</li>
            <li>Medical Attention Centers</li>
            <li>Gym</li>
            <li>Airplanes</li>
            <li>Public Transportation</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p><h3>Possible Health Side Effects Of Covid-19</h3></p>
        <p>
          Having Covid-19 as a kid has the possibility to lead to another other health risk. This side effect is Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C). Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome is a state where body parts become inflamed like the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or other internal organs. During the time of illness or in the future, MIS-C can lead to life threatening problems with the internal organs in the body.
          <br>
          <br>
          The symptoms for MIS-C include
          <ul>
            <li>Fever</li>
            <li>Rashes</li>
            <li>Conjunctivitis (redness of the white part in the eye)</li>
            <li>Stomachaches</li>
            <li>Vomiting/Diarrhea</li>
            <li>Lymph Node in the Neck</li>
            <li>Red, Cracked Lips</li>
            <li>Tongue Being Extremely Red</li>
            <li>Swollen Hands and/or Feet</li>
            <li>Irritability, Unusual Sleepiness, or Weakness</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p><h3>Statistics On MIS-C</h3></p>
        <p>
          So far there have been 342 cases found in children throughout 37 states within the US, however 6 of these children have unfortunately died. MIS-C varies case ratios for gender; 55% of cases are males and 45% of cases are females.

        <p><h3>Should Schools Open Again</h3></p>
        <p>
          If schools were to open again they would have both positive and negative effects on the lives of everyone. Some positive effects of school reopening are that students will not fall behind on the material needed to learn throughout the academic year, it will help relieve tension and stress in students, and teachers can help those students that need extra assistance. However, this can lead to students becoming the host to the virus, taking it back to their families, and causing their family to be infected. So overall rates for adults and elderly being infected would increase. This means parents as well as grandparents will be at a high risk.        
        </p>
        <p>If school weren’t to open again they would have both positive and negative effects on mainly the students and their families. Some of the effects of not reopening school are that students can suffer long term academic consequences, can put a stop on developing skills to regulate their own behavior, emotions, and attention,and can later in the future struggle with learning.
